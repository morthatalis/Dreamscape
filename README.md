# About
Dreamscape, a roblox website remake.  
All usable as html files.  
This remake doesnt use any credentials to operate (aka you *cant* log into this website).  
This doesn't spy on you, like how the roblox website spies on you (ok telementry, not spying, basically spying though).  
# Features (currently)
Recently played (saved on your browser),  
Games page & Game Page(both very basic),  
UserID saving, Home page
Searching, Profiles. (in the future Friends list, on homepage)
# How to use localhost/host this
install nodejs (search on yt or google it)
clone this repo (either using github desktop, or doing git clone https://github.com/morthatalis/Dreamscape/ in your terminal)
and when done, use the provided runserver.cmd file
# There's no need for a server though.
There's no need for to host this,  
since this all works as html files  
(you need all of these files to work, since main.js, stdinc.js and styles.css is what every page's cores)
if you dont wanna host this, just install github desktop and then clone this (not fork)  
have fun :D
